sigen - randomized parameters generator for software injection

1. Prerequisites

   Gnu Scientific Library (GSL) is needed to compile it.

2. How to compile the program?

   Run "make sigen". The resulting binary is called "sigen". 
   Modify CFLAGS and LDFLAGS in the Makefile if needed.

3. How to run the program?

   "./sigen <-d data_dir> -b  band", where data_dir is the 
   base directory of input data files (optional, set to "." by default). 
   "band" is the number of frequency  band  (see "Structure  of  VSR1  data" 
   in readme_search.txt). For example:

   ./sigen -b 271
 
   Complete list of switches include:
	-a <num>	GW amplitude (default value: 2.e-3) 
	-b <num>	Frequency band number
	-c <dir>	changes the working directory to <dir>
	-d <dir>	Data directory in case of lines (default is .)
	-s <num>	Grid search range (+- the injection position, 
				in grid coordinates; default value: 2)

	--help          prints a help message 

4. Output

   sigen produces randomized parameters (using C rand() function 
   with the seed taken from /dev/urandom) of a continuous GW signal, 
   in the following order:  
   
   amp			GW amplitude (default value: 2.e-3)    
   gsize		size of the grid in which search will be performed
			(+- spnd, nn and mm; default value is 2) 
   pm			hemisphere (1 or 2)
   sgnlo[0]		Signal frequency
   sgnlo[1]		Frequency derivative (spindown)
   sgnlo[2]		Declination
   sgnlo[3]		Right ascension		
   sgnlo[4-7]		Modulation amplitudes (while actual adding the signal 
			to the data, these are multiplied by amp)
   be1                  sky position in linear coords., divided by oms
                        (dimensional angular freq.)
   be2                  idem
	
5. Avoiding known lines and near-pole regions 
	Description to be added 

6. Additional documentation 
 
   Doxygen documentation may be generated by typing "make doc" from 
   the src directory - it will reside in doc/html.
