==============

All-sky search code (Polgraw group)

This code searches for continuous gravitational waves  
in time-domain data using the F-statistic. 
See doc/readme_search.txt for more details.

This branch is meant to serve as a senstivity 
simulation pipeline - a software injection 
generated by sigen is injected into the input 
data and then searched for by search in the whole 
band range (all the available frames).
